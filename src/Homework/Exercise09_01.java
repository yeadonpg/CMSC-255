/**
 * (The Rectangle class)
 *
 * Following the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2, design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle.
 *
 * The class contains:
 *
 * - Two double data fields named width and height that specify the width and height of the rectangle.
 * The default values are 1 for both width and height.
 *
 * - A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle.
 *
 * - A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height.
 *
 * - A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle.
 *
 * - A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.
 *
 *
 * Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class.
 *
 * Write a test program that creates two Rectangle objectsâ€”one with width 4 and height 40 and the other
 * with width 3.5 and height 35.9.
 *
 * Display the width, height, area, and perimeter of each rectangle in this order.
 * **/
